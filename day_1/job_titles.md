# What kind of job are you looking for?

### Full-Stack
	
A full-stack web developer does a little bit of everything. You might be expected to work on individual features both on the front-end and back-end of things if you're a part of a team. You may spend your time working on making the code from the back-end and fron-end teams compatible with each other and make sure the site is functional as they make changes. You might work as a freelancer helping people with any myriad of problems or issues with their websites. A full-stack developer does it all but specializes in none, you're the jack of all trades.

### Back-end

Back-end developers work on the functional parts of the website. You'll spend your time programming applications, databases, and/or server management. Your job is to ensure that when the server communicates with the client, everything runs quickly and efficiently. Back end development is for you if you're somebody who loves data manipulation, functional programming, and are fascinated by the behind the scenes aspects of the world wide web as a whole.

You've already learned Python, but other server side languages like PHP, Ruby, Java, .Net might be helpful to learn to further your understanding, and may in fact be required or demanded by your workplace. SQL, MySQL, and/or Oracle may also be helpful to study to further your understanding of server and database programming.

### Front-end

As a front-end web developer you're all about presentation. You're going to be making everything that people see when they open your site. You thrive on making sites that look absolutely fantastic, and smile when your client's eyes light up when they see how great their new site looks before they've even begun to get into the site's functionality. You're a web artist of sorts, styling and formatting your website in a clean, efficient, and visually stunning manner.

You'll be doing most of your work in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and using libraries like JQUERY to make your code more efficient. An understanding of front end Frameworks, like those listed below, will help with device compatibility and version control to ensure consistently great looking content.

### Software Engineer

If you just love programming and want to do as much of it as possible, but perhaps weren't entranced by the web aspect of programming, maybe a job in software engineering could be for you. A software engineer may do a number of things but focuses mainly on systems level programming and application development for businesses, either as an employee or as a contractor. They may also be responsible for determining the needs of different departments within a corporation and handling their networking and technical work so they can do their work as efficiently as possible.

### Systems Analyst

Systems Analysts are all about efficiency. As a systems analyst you don't just love clean code, but fast code too. This is a good job for you if you enjoy code, talking tech, and mathematics but not necessarily doing the actual coding yourself. As a systems analyst you'll spend a lot of your time creating predictive models, doing cost analysis, and determining the best design schemes and implementations for solving problems using information technology. A knowledge of many programming languages, operating systems, etc. is very helpful to a systems analyst even though they may not be doing most of the programming. Also a good job for you if you'd like to spend your actual programming time on personal projects instead of your job, while still utilizing your programming knowledge in the workplace.

### Quality Assurance

Working in quality assurance can be highly rewarding if you're interested in the design process as a whole, and enjoy interacting with and talking to the many different people you may be working with. You oversee the design process and test code throughout (though you're not exclusively a software tester, which is another job you could pursue if you so wished) to ensure that you get a product out on time that meets the standards of both the government and the company that you're working for. As the name might suggest, you're responsible for the quality of the product, and it's ability to bring monetary success to your company.

### Technical Writing

Like a systems analyst, maybe you love coding and technology but don't necessarily want to be doing it every day in your workplace? Maybe you would like to continue expanding your knowledge about all aspects of technology rather than specializing in a specific field. If that sounds like something that interests you then technical writing could be for you. As a technical writer you can write about all industries of science and technology as long as you're willing to study enough to build a good foundation of knowledge on the subject matter (the more knowledgeable you are about a subject the better your writing on it will be). You'll spend a lot of your time writing of course, but a lot of your time will also be spent studying and keeping up with the latest trends and developments in science and technology.

### Teaching/Training

Much like technical writing, your job as a teacher or trainer is to learn about all manner of technologies and procedures so that you can show others how to use technology. This is another good role for someone who would like to continue expanding your knowledge about all aspects of technology rather than specializing in a specific field. Depending on the position, you could spend your time running classes, workshops, or sessions, or you could be writing plans so that others can do the training. Either way, good writing and communication skills are a must. As with technical writing, you will also spend much of your time studying and keeping up with the latest developments in the world of development.

### Technical Support Engineer

This is a role you can find at companies that make B2B (business to business) products where the end users are other developers, rather than consumers. Basically, if a developer using the company's tools has an issue or question, you're the one to help them. This is not a conventional "tech support" job, but requires someone familiar with the development tools and programming languages that the company's products integrate with. You won't be answering phone calls, but will get tickets to help the company's customers. These positions pay about as well as a junior developer, and since technical support engineers are often promoted to developers, can be a great way to get your foot in the door.

### Data Engineering/Data Analysis

There are a number of roles working with data for which you could use your Python knowledge. Data engineers write the code to clean, organize, move, and transform data so that it is in the right place and right format for data scientists to analyze. Additionally, you could be a data analyst and be one of the ones doing the analysis. Data engineers work with databases, cloud computing, and automation, while data analysis utilizes libraries like Pandas. In general, data engineering only requires programming and IT experience, while data analysis or data science often requires addition math and statistics knowledge.

### DevOps

DevOps lies at the intersection of IT operations and software development. DevOps professionals are responsible for designing and implementing the workflows and tooling that developers will then use to develop software and deploy it. If you have a background in IT and want to combine that with programming, this can be a great (and well paying!) career choice. DevOps engineers need knowledge of both OS/serverside setup, and the development tools and programming languages that the developers are using. A strong DevOps engineer can debug or troubleshoot almost anything!

## Freelancing

Freelancing is a great way to both gain experience that you can potentially add to your resume and/or portfolio, and also to learn new skills and take on new projects that you may not have considered tackling before. Additionally, theres the added benefits (not to say there aren't also drawbacks) of being in charge of your own schedule, your own work location and essentially being your own boss (although you'll still often be at the mercy of the desires of the client).

There are several websites and options to consider when approaching freelancing, some of these are:

1. [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com) Great for beginner freelancers.
2. [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com) Good once you've built up some experience.
3. [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com) Compete with other programmers in coding competitions. Win alot to make yourself more valuable looking to clients seeking your freelance services.
4. [Craigslist](https://www.portland.craigslist.org) Really? Yes, really. Offer up your services and see who bites. Or look	for postings by people already seeking out freelance web design services.
5. [Guru](https://www.guru.com) Lets you showcase past experience easily. Good once you've accumulated  some demonstrable work.
6. [99designs](https://99designs.com) Compete with other web designers. Good if your primary interest is making and designing visually stunning and interactive websites.
7. Your own portfolio site! Design your portfolio around your projects to showcase your skills. Sell yourself as a professional freelancer, print up business cards with links to your site, network, etc. If you're confident in your skills you can let your work speak for itself and let the jobs roll in. (Make sure people have a way of finding your site)
