Here are some tips to help you leverage the platform to land yourself a job. 

## Your Portfolio

Many people use their LinkedIn profile as just another way to show off their resume, but there’s so much more to it than just posting your previous experience! Think of your profile as a sales page, and you are the service! Your title, photo and bio matter and should make it easy for someone to quickly get a feel for what you do.

- Title: Use keywords to help people find you such as ‘Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer’. This title is packed with keywords that people can use to find you in the search bar, as well as quickly know what your skills and qualifications are. As a student, although you are still learning, consider what you already know and place an emphasis on those languages and titles. Avoid terms such as “unemployed”, “student” or “seeking employment.” These are not helpful keywords and are better placed in your bio if you do choose to use any of them. 

- Bio: Bios are another great opportunity to drop keywords that will stand out to potential employers. It’s also an opportunity to put some of your skills and past achievements into context. As a developer, no one is expecting you to be a novelist so don’t overthink it. Feel free to keep it brief, but share your programming experience thus far, your passion for programming and goals of what you are most interested in. This could be compared to a general cover letter. 

- Photo: Your photo doesn’t have to be a professional headshot, but make sure you are the only one in the photo and that it’s a nice, quality close up (not too close!) of your face.

## Adding New Contacts 

Finding and connecting with the right people is a great place to start in order to leverage your contacts and your reach on LinkedIn. It’s becoming more and more commonplace to accept requests from strangers whom you share commonalities such as living in the same area or in the same line of work. The more connections you have, the more potential connections you can have since you need to be at least [3rd degree connections](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/110/your-network-and-degrees-of-connection?lang=en) in order to connect with someone. Here are some helpful starting points to grow and connect with your network.

### Search Your Network With Filters

1. Navigate to “My Network” on the desktop version of LinkedIn
2. Click “Connections” 
3. Click “Search With Filters”
4. Here you can search by location, company, schools, or all 3! A great place to start would be searching alumni in your area whose in your industry. 
5. Message those who have some commonalities and/or at a company you’re interested in. 

### Make New Connections Using Companies

1. On the LinkedIn homepage, click the search bar and click “Companies”. 
2. Visit any company’s profile that interests you, and right at the top of their page you’ll see “See All XXX Employees On LinkedIn”
3. From here, just start connecting with anyone you can! Remember, the more connections you have, the more connections you can have.
4. If your having a hard time finding a company on LinkedIn, try navigating to their website and see if they have a quicklink to their LinkedIn page!  

Don’t be shy to add connections. Most people who are actively on LinkedIn are there because they want to grow their network, connect and help others! Once you are connected, you can direct message them and it also allows you to connect with their 1st and 2nd, and sometimes 3rd connections. 

## Direct Messaging

Direct messaging authentically is a great way to learn from other people’s experiences and maybe even get a referral with your application to that company! If you are like most programmers I know, writing may not be your favorite thing so I’ll make it easy for you and provide a couple of starter templates to work off of if it’s helpful to you. 

- “Hi (name) thanks for accepting my connection! I noticed you worked at (company) and I’ve read that the only way to get in the company is through a referral or contract jobs. Was this your experience? How did you get your foot in the door?”

-   “Hi (name) thanks for accepting my connection! I’m interested in working at (company) and would appreciate any advice you could give to help me head that direction. Currently I’m a (student/ junior/ entry level __, etc.) but am working on my application for (company). What skillsets are they more interested in?” 

Always remember, if and when you message someone and they message back, make sure to respond! Feel free to ask follow up questions or even just respond with “I really appreciate the response! Thank you!” People appreciate the closure and acknowledgement that their message was helpful, and it’s just good karma.
