# Github Profile

Make sure it has your contact info and a picture. Star at least two respositories to highlight them for visitors. Aim to push changes to github at least once a day to keep your activity graph green.

# Personal Profile Website

You should already have a personal portfolio website from bootcamp. Now is the time to spruce it up. It should have the following:

- Graphics (does not have to be a headshot)
- Professional looking CSS (does not have to be fancy; when in doubt keep it minimal)
- A short bio or summary (only needs to be 1-2 paragraphs long)
- At least three porfolio projects. You can start with your capstone, Python mini-capstone, and JavaScript mini-capstone. Try to include enticing info about each one -- gold standard is a name, picture/screenshot, description, and links to both the code and a deployed version if you have one
- Work/Educational history (optional)
- Contact info and links to other profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc)

A great (and free) way to host your personal portfolio website is using GitHub pages. I would strongly recommend also purchasing a custom domain.
