# Personal Coding Projects

Have an idea for a program or website? Make it! chances are you'll learn something new in the process. And, even if you don't, if you create a polished enough looking or functional enough product you can slap it on your portfolio and showcase it to the world.

The best reason to take on independent projects is for the sake of learning new skills. Interested in databases? Learn SQL. Love game programming? C++ could be for you. Here's a brief list of some fields and related skills that may be worth pursuing to expand your knowledge:

- Different web frameworks and lanagugaes (Java / Dropwizard, Ruby / Rails, etc.)
- Unit, integration, contract testing
- Advanced Git
- Systems programming (C, C++, Rust, Go, etc.)
- Data analysis (R, Pandas, NumPy, Matlab, etc.)
- Distributed data processing (Hadoop, Kafka, Storm, etc.)
- Front-end frameworks (AngularJS, React, Bootstrap, etc.)
- Shell scripting, administration, and advanced command line tools (bash, grep, sed, etc.)
- Mobile development (iOS: Swift, Objective-C, Android: Java, etc.)
- Database types and interfaces (SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, etc.)
- Game programming (C, C++, D, OpenGL, etc.)
