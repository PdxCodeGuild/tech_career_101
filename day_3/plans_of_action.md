# Plans of Action

Your portfolio and job search plans of action should list the next steps toward getting hired that you are going to take after completing Tech Career 101. Think of this as your to-do list for your job search. When you turn them in, lists of bullet points are perfectly fine -- again, these are to-do lists to help you organize your process and decide what you are doing next.

Here are some basic examples to get your brain going, but what you come upo with is going to be different depending on you and your unique job search.

## Portfolio Examples

- Learn Django Rest Framework
- Deploy a project
- Start a new portfolio project
- Build mockups to demonstrate CSS skills
- Complete online SQL course

## Job Search Examples

- Reach out to 10 people for informational interviews
- Attend hackathon
- Attend React meetup
- Make a list of companies to target
- Apply to jobs
