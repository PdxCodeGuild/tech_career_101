# Thanks Email

You should have a template of a "thank you for talking with me today" email, so that when you do talk or interview with someone it only takes a second for you to send an email thanking them for their time.

1. Thank them for their time
2. Recap what was discussed
3. Link it back to your skills or what was discussed
4. Anything else (this depends on the exact person/situation you're replying to)
5. If applicable, tell them you're looking forward to speaking to them again

## Example

Hello {{ Name of Person }},

Thank you for talking with me today. It was so useful to have the chance to pick your brain and learn more about what the day-to-day experience is like at {{ Name of Company }}. As per your suggestions, I will continue to work on my Django Rest Framework skills. Again, thank you, and I look forward to talking with you in the future.

Thank you,
{{ Your Full Name }}
